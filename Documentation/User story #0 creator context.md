## Why This App Exists

**Created by:** Graeme Wright  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** Foundational Use Case

## The Personal Context

### Physical Profile

**Active Lifestyle:**
- Regular runner
- Tennis player (2x/week)
- Football player (6-a-side, weekly)
- **Goal:** Maintain active lifestyle despite chronic issues

**Injury History:**
- **Lower back:** Herniated bulging disc
- **Sciatica:** Bilateral, triggered by:
  - Climbing stairs
  - Left leg step-ups
  - Certain movements/positions
- **Right shoulder/collarbone:** Chronic issues
- **Right wrist:** Sore and weak
- **Hamstring:** Recently strained (5 weeks ago, still recovering)

### Psychological Profile

**ADHD Characteristics:**
- Dopamine addiction patterns
- Drops projects when encountering barriers
- Needs immediate gratification
- Requires acknowledgement/feedback
- Demands frictionless experience

**The Barrier Problem:**
> "I drop projects and exercise if I encounter barriers. These are the reasons I want to build this app."

## The Core Insight

### The Problem Traditional Apps Create

**When injury happens, people stop exercising entirely:**
- Frozen shoulder → "I can't work out"
- Sprained ankle → "I'll wait until it heals"
- Back flare-up → "Exercise is dangerous right now"
- **Result:** Complete cessation, muscle loss, mood decline

**The ADHD Amplifier:**
- Barrier + Dopamine dysregulation = Dropped habit
- One missed workout becomes two weeks
- Guilt accumulates, restart becomes harder
- "I'm not athletic" narrative reinforces

### The Solution Vision

**Alongside adapts AROUND problems:**
- Sprained ankle → Upper body strength, core, breathing work
- Frozen shoulder → Leg work, cardio, gentle mobility
- Sciatica flare → Swimming, yoga, walking, upper body
- Low energy → Stretching, tai chi, breathwork
- **Result:** Movement continues, identity preserved

**But also knows when to stop:**
- Burnout detection → Recovery mode
- High pain levels → Rest prioritized
- Psychological safety → "It's okay to rest"
- No shame → Fresh start daily

## Design Principles Born from This

### 1. **Comprehensive Condition Management**

Not just "Do you have back pain?" but:
- **Specific diagnosis:** Herniated disc vs muscle strain vs sciatica
- **Bilateral tracking:** Left leg vs right leg symptoms
- **Multiple simultaneous issues:** Back + shoulder + wrist + hamstring
- **Daily variability:** Pain levels change, app adapts

### 2. **ADHD-First Architecture**

**Frictionless experience:**
- Minimal cognitive load (2 sliders, not 10 questions)
- Immediate feedback (credits awarded instantly)
- Visual progress (not just numbers)
- No shame mechanics (fresh start daily)

**Barrier removal:**
- Can't do legs? Here's upper body
- No equipment? Here's bodyweight
- Tired? Here's gentle movement
- **Maintain the habit loop** even when compromised

### 3. **Psychological Safety Over Performance**

**Two critical questions:**
1. "Should I exercise today?" (Burnout detection)
2. "What CAN I do today?" (Adaptive filtering)

**Not:**
- "What SHOULD I do?" (prescriptive)
- "What did I plan?" (rigid)
- "Am I falling behind?" (shame-inducing)

## The Universal Application

### Why This Matters Beyond One Person

**Graeme's profile represents millions:**
- 15-20% of population is neurodivergent
- Chronic pain affects 28 million UK adults
- Active people get injured regularly
- Life stress impacts everyone
- Burnout is epidemic

**The Insight:**
> "Any user can experience any of these issues and many others... the app needs to adjust to fit any problems faced by the user."

**The Design Principle:**
Build for the complex case (multiple injuries + ADHD + life stress), and you automatically solve for the simple case (one injury, no ADHD).

**Inverse fails:**
Build for the simple case (healthy 25-year-old with no responsibilities), and you exclude everyone else.

## Success Criteria

**For Graeme (and users like him):**

✅ Can check in daily in <60 seconds  
✅ Gets workout options that respect ALL current injuries  
✅ Sees transparent rationale ("I'm protecting your back today")  
✅ Never feels guilt for low energy days  
✅ Maintains exercise identity even when injured  
✅ Experiences psychological safety around rest  
✅ Continues movement habit despite barriers  

**Critical Measure:**
"Did I exercise THIS WEEK despite [injury/stress/low energy]?"

Not: "Did I hit my weekly targets?"  
Not: "Did I maintain my streak?"  
Not: "Am I improving?"

## Documentation Status

**This document should be referenced:**
- In every feature specification
- In every design decision
- In every coaching message review
- In every UX pattern choice

**When in doubt, ask:**
"Would this help Graeme maintain his exercise habit when his hamstring is acting up and he's had a rough week at work?"

If no → wrong feature
If yes → build it
