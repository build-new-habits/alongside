## 🎯 EXECUTIVE VISION (2-Page Summary)

### **What Is Alongside?**

Alongside is a **compassionate fitness coaching app** designed specifically for neurodivergent adults and women managing complex life circumstances. Unlike traditional fitness apps that impose rigid programs, Alongside adapts daily recommendations based on energy, mood, injuries, and life context.

**Core Philosophy:** *"Listen first, prescribe second"*

---

### **The Problem We're Solving**

Traditional fitness apps fail people who:
- Have fluctuating energy levels (burnout, chronic conditions, neurodivergence)
- Manage injuries or chronic pain
- Face unpredictable life circumstances
- Need compassionate coaching, not punishment mechanics
- Want transparency, not "black box" AI recommendations

**Market Gap:** No existing app combines daily adaptation with progressive goal tracking while maintaining a shame-free, compassionate approach.

---

### **Target Market**

**Primary:** Educational institutions (Colleges, Universities)
- 200K-450K potential users in UK education sector
- B2B licensing model
- Addresses wellbeing initiatives and staff/student health

**Secondary:** Individual subscriptions
- Neurodivergent adults
- People with chronic conditions
- Women managing hormonal fluctuations
- Anyone seeking adaptive, compassionate fitness coaching

---

### **Unique Value Proposition**

1. **Daily Adaptation** - Workouts change based on how you feel TODAY
2. **Transparent Logic** - No black-box AI; you see exactly why exercises were chosen
3. **Condition-Safe** - Filters exercises by injuries and contraindications
4. **Burnout Detection** - Automatically switches to recovery mode when patterns indicate exhaustion
5. **Progressive Plans** - Structured programs that adapt if you miss workouts

---

### **Phase 2: Strategic Layer - 0% COMPLETE**

**This is the MISSING 50% that transforms the app from "daily random workouts" to "true progressive coaching toward goals."**

#### **Not Yet Built:**
- ❌ SMART goal setting (with targets, deadlines, milestones)
- ❌ Progressive plans (12-week structured programs)
- ❌ Strategic rationale (linking daily workouts to long-term goals)
- ❌ Milestone tracking and celebrations
- ❌ Progress dashboard (visual goal progress)
- ❌ Adaptive periodization (build/push/peak/recovery phases)
- ❌ Performance tracking (are you getting stronger/faster?)

**Critical Gap:**
Without Phase 2, users have no sense of:
- What they're building toward
- Whether they're on track
- When they'll achieve their goals
- How today's workout fits into the bigger picture

---

## 🗺️ ROADMAP: WHERE WE'RE GOING

### **Immediate Priority: Fix Phase 1 Issues (Next Session)**

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Focus:** Exercise card functionality + time display

**Tasks:**
1. Fix exercise card click handlers (no more errors)
2. Convert time display to minutes (not seconds)
3. Add sets/reps/rest breakdown for strength exercises
4. Verify total workout time calculation
5. Restore countdown timer for timed exercises

**Why This Matters:**
Users can't use the app properly if cards don't open and times are confusing.

---

### **Phase 2: Strategic Layer (Next 4-6 Weeks)**

#### **Week 1-2: Goal Setting System**
**Deliverable:** Users can set SMART goals with targets and deadlines

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  goal: "Run 45 minutes pain-free",
  current: 15 minutes,
  target: 45 minutes,
  deadline: "2026-03-15",
  milestones: [
    { target: 20, date: "2026-02-05" },
    { target: 30, date: "2026-02-26" },
    { target: 45, date: "2026-03-15" }
  ]
}
```

**Impact:** Users now have a clear target to work toward.

---

#### **Week 3-4: Progressive Plans**
**Deliverable:** 5 pre-built 12-week programs

**Plans:**
1. Couch to 45-Minute Run
2. Beginner Strength Builder
3. Mobility & Pain Management
4. HIIT Conditioning
5. Wellbeing & Stress Management

**How They Work:**
- Each week has specific workout targets
- Plans adapt if user misses workouts
- Progressive difficulty over 12 weeks
- Phases: Build (Weeks 1-4), Push (5-8), Peak (9-12)

**Impact:** Users follow a structured program, not random daily workouts.

---

#### **Week 5-6: Strategic Rationale + Milestones**
**Deliverable:** Every workout explains its role in the plan

**Old Rationale:**
> "Your energy is 7/10 - perfect for challenging work"

**New Rationale:**
> "Your energy is 7/10 - perfect for Week 3 of your running plan. This tempo run builds endurance for your 45-min goal in March. You're on track! 🎯"

**Plus:** Automatic milestone celebrations when targets hit

**Impact:** Users understand WHY they're doing today's workout and feel motivated by progress.

---

#### **Week 7-8: Progress Dashboard**
**Deliverable:** Visual display of goals and progress

**Features:**
- Goal progress bars (% to target)
- Weekly stats (workouts completed, credits earned)
- Performance trends (getting faster/stronger?)
- Milestone history
- On-track warnings ("Need to increase 3 min/week to hit deadline")

**Impact:** Users see their progress visually, get motivated by gains.

---

## 🎓 SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION

### **Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)**

**Three Psychological Needs:**
1. **Autonomy** - Users choose workouts, not forced into programs
2. **Competence** - Progressive difficulty, achievable challenges, clear feedback
3. **Relatedness** - Compassionate coaching tone, understanding context

**How Alongside Implements:**
- Daily choice between 3 workout options (autonomy)
- Difficulty matched to energy level (competence)
- Transparent rationale shows we "understand" user (relatedness)

---

### **SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes)**

**Progressive Complexity:**
1. **Prestructural** - Can't do exercise
2. **Unistructural** - Can do exercise with help
3. **Multistructural** - Can do exercise independently
4. **Relational** - Can link exercises into workouts
5. **Extended Abstract** - Can design own programs

**How Alongside Implements:**
- Difficulty feedback captures user's SOLO level
- Exercises adapt based on demonstrated competence
- Progressive plans move users up SOLO levels systematically

---

### **Mood Meter (Marc Brackett, Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence)**

**4-Quadrant Model:**
- High Energy + Pleasant = Excited, Energized
- High Energy + Unpleasant = Stressed, Anxious
- Low Energy + Pleasant = Calm, Peaceful
- Low Energy + Unpleasant = Sad, Tired

**How Alongside Implements:**
- 2-slider check-in captures energy AND mood
- Workout generation considers both dimensions
- Low mood + high energy = Use exercise for mood regulation
- Low mood + low energy = Gentle wellbeing focus

---

### **Burnout Research (Dr. Claire Plumbly, 2024)**

**Nervous System Dysregulation Patterns:**
- Consecutive low energy
- Poor sleep + low mood
- Pain flare + exhaustion
- Combined crashes

**How Alongside Implements:**
- 7-day check-in history analysis
- Pattern detection algorithms
- Automatic recovery mode
- Prevents overtraining when burned out

---
