## 🎯 PRODUCT VISION

### The Problem We're Solving

**45 million adults in the UK struggle with fitness** - not because they lack motivation, but because traditional fitness apps are built for a mythical "perfect user" who:
- Has unlimited time and energy
- Never gets injured
- Doesn't have ADHD, anxiety, or depression
- Can follow rigid programs without adaptation
- Doesn't menstruate or experience hormonal changes
- Responds well to shame-based motivation ("Don't break your streak!")

**This excludes:**
- 15-20% of the population who are neurodivergent (ADHD, autism)
- 51% of the population who menstruate and experience hormonal fluctuations
- Millions managing chronic conditions (back pain, knee issues, burnout)
- Busy parents balancing careers, families, and personal health
- Anyone who has ever felt "gym shame" or failed to maintain a fitness routine

### Our Solution

**Alongside is the world's first compassionate fitness coach designed from the ground up for neurodivergent adults and people managing complex life circumstances.**

Instead of prescribing rigid programs that you must follow, Alongside **"listens first, prescribes second"** - adapting daily recommendations based on:
- Your energy level today (1-10)
- Your mood today (1-10)
- How you slept last night
- Your injury/pain levels right now
- Your menstrual cycle phase (if tracking)
- Your life context (stressed, traveling, celebrating)

**The result:** A fitness coach that feels like it truly understands you, not one that makes you feel guilty for being human.

## 🧠 PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

### Why Neurodivergent-First Design Matters

**Neurodivergent users aren't edge cases - they're 15-20% of the population.**

Traditional fitness apps fail neurodivergent users because they:
1. **Assume executive function** - "Just follow the plan" doesn't work when planning is hard
2. **Use shame-based motivation** - Broken streaks trigger anxiety spirals in ADHD users
3. **Lack transparency** - "Why this exercise?" is a genuine need, not a nice-to-have
4. **Exploit dopamine dysregulation** - Variable rewards and FOMO tactics are harmful
5. **Ignore context** - A bad night's sleep or injury makes rigid plans impossible

**Alongside flips this:**
1. **Minimal executive function required** - Daily check-in takes <60 seconds
2. **No shame, ever** - Missing a day loses nothing, fresh start every morning
3. **Transparent rationale** - Every recommendation explains why it was suggested
4. **Ethical rewards** - Credits for real activity, no manipulation
5. **Context-aware** - Adapts to your actual state, not an idealized version of you

### The Science Behind Our Approach

Our design is grounded in evidence-based psychological frameworks:

#### 1. Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)
**Core Principle:** People are motivated by autonomy, competence, and relatedness - not external pressure.

**How Alongside Applies This:**
- **Autonomy:** You choose which workout to do (3 options daily), or skip entirely
- **Competence:** Exercises matched to your skill level, progressive overload built in
- **Relatedness:** Compassionate coaching language, "we're in this together" tone

#### 2. SOLO Taxonomy (Biggs & Collis)
**Core Principle:** Learning progresses through structured levels from simple to complex understanding.

**How Alongside Applies This:**
- **Unistructural:** Single exercise (e.g., bodyweight squat)
- **Multistructural:** Multiple exercises (e.g., full lower body workout)
- **Relational:** Understanding how exercises connect to goals
- **Extended Abstract:** Creating own workout variations

Exercise recommendations automatically scaffold from simple to complex as you progress.

#### 3. Mood Meter Science (Marc Brackett, Yale RULER)
**Core Principle:** Emotional awareness requires two dimensions - energy and pleasantness.

**How Alongside Applies This:**
- Check-in captures energy (1-10) and mood (1-10) separately
- Exercise recommendations adapt to both dimensions
- Low energy + low mood → Gentle, endorphin-boosting movements
- High energy + low mood → Stress-relief cardio
- Low energy + high mood → Light, enjoyable activities

#### 4. Burnout Research (Dr. Claire Plumbly)
**Core Principle:** Burnout is nervous system dysregulation, detectable through energy patterns.

**How Alongside Applies This:**
- Monitors for 3+ consecutive days with energy ≤3
- Activates "Recovery Mode" with gentle-only recommendations
- Message: "You've been running on low energy lately. That's okay - we're focusing on rest."
- No pressure to "push through" - recovery is the priority

**Reference:** *Burnout: How to Manage Your Nervous System Before It Manages You*, Dr. Claire Plumbly, Yellow Kite 2024, ISBN 978-1-399-73342-7

#### 5. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Principles
**Core Principle:** Psychological flexibility and values-based action lead to sustainable behavior change.

**How Alongside Applies This:**
- Exercises aligned with your stated goals and values
- Acceptance of current state ("Low energy is valid, not a failure")
- Commitment to action within current capacity
- No rigid rules, just flexible guidelines

### Women-First Design: Menstrual Cycle Awareness

**51% of the population experiences hormonal fluctuations that traditional fitness apps completely ignore.**

Alongside integrates menstrual cycle science:

**Menstruation Phase (Days 1-5):**
- Energy typically lowest
- Core compression exercises avoided
- Recommendation: Gentle movement, recovery focus

**Follicular Phase (Days 6-14):**
- Energy rising, estrogen increasing
- Optimal for strength building
- Recommendation: Progressive overload, skill development

**Ovulation Phase (Days 15-17):**
- Peak energy and coordination
- Ideal for high-intensity work
- Recommendation: PRs, challenging workouts

**Luteal Phase (Days 18-28):**
- Energy declining, progesterone rising
- Mood may fluctuate
- Recommendation: Steady-state cardio, moderate intensity

**Key Insight:** Women don't need to "push through" hormonal fluctuations. Working WITH your cycle leads to better results and less burnout.

### Men-First Design Too: Hormone Awareness

Alongside doesn't assume all users are the same:
- **Testosterone fluctuations** tracked for male users (morning vs. evening energy)
- **Aging considerations** (40s+ users have different recovery needs)
- **Stress hormones** (cortisol management through recovery recommendations)

## 🎨 CORE FEATURES

### 1. Daily Check-In System (60 seconds)

**Purpose:** Capture your actual state today, not an idealized version.

**Components:**
- **Energy Slider (1-10):** Physical capacity today
  - 1: "Exhausted - rest is the priority"
  - 5: "Moderate - steady does it"
  - 10: "Peak energy - make it count!"

- **Mood Slider (1-10):** Emotional state today
  - 1: "Really struggling - be gentle with yourself"
  - 5: "Neutral - steady as she goes"
  - 10: "Fantastic - ride this wave!"

- **Sleep Tracking:**
  - Hours slept (4-10+)
  - Sleep quality (1-5 rating)

- **Hydration:** Low / OK / Good

- **Menstrual Cycle (Optional):** Day of cycle (1-28+)

- **Condition Updates:** Rate each injury/condition daily
  - Pain slider (0-10)
  - Difficulty slider (0-10)
  - Example: "Knee - Pain: 3/10, Difficulty: 6/10" → System suggests stability work

**Why This Works:**
- **Neurodivergent-friendly:** Takes <60 seconds, minimal cognitive load
- **Validates experience:** Low values acknowledged as legitimate, not problems to fix
- **Drives adaptation:** Every metric directly influences workout recommendations
- **Pattern detection:** Historical data enables burnout detection

### 2. Active Coach: Smart Workout Recommendations

**The Core Differentiator - What Makes Alongside Unique**

Every day, the Active Coach generates **3 personalized workout options:**

1. **Strength Focus** - Build muscle, power, functional strength
2. **Wellbeing Focus** - Mobility, stretching, nervous system regulation
3. **Cardio Focus** - Heart health, endurance, calorie burn

**How It Works (Behind the Scenes):**

```
Step 1: Read Your Context
→ Energy: 6/10
→ Mood: 7/10
→ Sleep: 7 hours, quality 4/5
→ Conditions: Lower back (pain 5/10, difficulty 3/10)
→ Equipment: Dumbbells, yoga mat, foam roller
→ Goals: Lose weight, build core strength, run 5K

Step 2: Filter Exercise Database
→ Remove: Exercises requiring equipment you don't have
→ Block: Exercises that stress your lower back (pain 5/10 = caution)
→ Match: Exercises requiring energy level 4-8 (within your capacity)
→ Prioritize: Exercises beneficial for lower back, core strength, running

Step 3: Generate 3 Options
→ Strength: Lower body + core (avoiding back stress)
→ Wellbeing: Mobility + gentle stretching
→ Cardio: Easy run intervals (low-impact)

Step 4: Add Transparent Rationale
→ "Your energy is 6/10 - perfect for steady work"
→ "Protecting your lower back (pain: 5/10)"
→ "Building core strength for your running goal"
```

**Transparent Rationale (Trust Through Transparency):**

Every workout option shows you WHY it was recommended:

**Example Rationale:**
> **"Why This Workout Today?"**
> 
> ✅ Your energy is 7/10 - perfect for strength building  
> ⚠️ Protecting your lower back (pain: 5/10) - no spinal loading today  
> 🎯 Building core stability for your goal: Run 5K without injury  
> 💤 Well-rested from good sleep - slightly higher volume today  

**This transparency:**
- Builds trust with ADHD users (need to understand "why")
- Validates self-reported state (system "listens" to you)
- Educates over time (users learn what works for them)
- Reduces "black box" anxiety about AI recommendations

### 3. Hierarchical Condition Management

**Traditional apps:** "Do you have any injuries? Yes/No"
**Alongside:** "Tell me exactly where it hurts, what it feels like, and how it affects you"

**3-Level Condition System:**

**Level 1: Body Region**
→ Lower back, Upper back, Neck, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Hip, Knee, Ankle, Hamstring, Calf, Foot

**Level 2: Specific Location**
→ Example (Lower Back): Left side, Right side, Center, Tailbone

**Level 3: Condition Type**
→ Example (Lower Back, Left Side): Muscle strain, Disc bulge, Sciatica, General stiffness

**Level 4: Daily Rating**
→ Pain (0-10): How much does it hurt right now?
→ Difficulty (0-10): How much does it limit movement?

**Why Pain vs. Difficulty Matters:**

**Scenario 1:** Knee - Pain 8/10, Difficulty 3/10
→ Hurts a lot, but you can still move
→ System Response: Caution warnings, prioritize gentle options

**Scenario 2:** Knee - Pain 2/10, Difficulty 8/10
→ Doesn't hurt much, but weak/unstable
→ System Response: Recommend stability work, avoid explosive movements

**Scenario 3:** Knee - Pain 9/10, Difficulty 9/10
→ Severe acute flare-up
→ System Response: BLOCK all knee exercises, suggest upper body only

**Exercise Filtering Logic:**
- **Pain 8-10:** Exercises affecting that area BLOCKED entirely
- **Pain 5-7:** Exercises shown with caution warning, deprioritized
- **Pain 1-4:** Exercises available with "Manageable" indicator
- **Difficulty 7-10:** Recommend stability/strengthening work for that area

### 4. Burnout Detection & Recovery Mode

**The Problem:** Many neurodivergent users push through exhaustion, leading to crashes.

**The Solution:** Automatic burnout detection activates "Recovery Mode"

**Detection Criteria:**
- 3+ consecutive days with energy ≤3
- Rolling 7-day average energy <4
- Combined low energy AND low mood patterns
- Severe pain flare (pain ≥8 for 2+ days)
- Poor sleep streak (quality ≤2 for 3+ days)

**Recovery Mode Response:**
When burnout detected, the app AUTOMATICALLY shifts:

**Visual Changes:**
- Gentle banner: "You've been running on low energy lately. That's okay."
- Color shifts to softer, calming tones
- "Recovery Mode" badge visible

**Workout Changes:**
- ALL high-intensity exercises removed
- Only gentle, restorative options shown
- Walking, stretching, breathwork prioritized
- Message: "We're focusing on gentle activities and rest. Take care of yourself."

**Exit Strategy:**
- "I'm feeling better" button (user control)
- Automatic exit after 3+ days of improved energy
- No pressure to rush recovery

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents crashes:** Catches burnout before it becomes severe
- **Reduces guilt:** System explicitly validates rest as necessary
- **Neurodivergent-friendly:** ADHD users often struggle to recognize burnout
- **Evidence-based:** Grounded in Dr. Claire Plumbly's nervous system research

### 5. Equipment-Adaptive Recommendations

**Traditional apps:** "Here's your workout" (assumes gym membership)
**Alongside:** "What equipment do you actually have?"

**Onboarding Equipment Selection:**
- Bodyweight only (always available)
- Dumbbells
- Kettlebell
- Resistance bands
- Pull-up bar
- Yoga mat
- Foam roller
- Bench
- Barbell
- Medicine ball
- Suspension trainer (TRX)
- Jump rope
- Boxing bag
- Boxing gloves
- + "Other" (expandable list)

**Smart Filtering:**
- Exercises requiring unavailable equipment are NEVER shown
- System automatically suggests bodyweight alternatives when possible
- Equipment needs displayed upfront for each workout

**Example:**
User has: Dumbbells, yoga mat, foam roller
→ Workout shows: Goblet squats (dumbbells), push-ups (mat), hip stretches (mat)
→ Workout does NOT show: Barbell deadlifts, kettlebell swings, TRX rows

### 6. Goal-Aligned Exercise Selection

**Onboarding Goal Capture:**

**Body Goals:**
- Lose weight
- Build muscle
- Get stronger
- Look more toned

**Fitness Goals:**
- Improve cardio
- Run a 5K
- Run a 10K
- Improve flexibility
- Get event-ready (wedding, holiday, etc.)

**Health Goals:**
- Move without pain
- Sleep better
- Have more energy

**Mental Goals:**
- Reduce stress
- Build exercise habit
- Feel confident in my body

**Custom Goals:**
- "Run Yeovil parkrun in under 30 minutes"
- "Deadlift my bodyweight by summer"
- "Touch my toes by Christmas"

**How Goals Drive Recommendations:**

User goal: "Lose weight by May 2025"
→ System prioritizes: High-calorie exercises, HIIT, strength (muscle burns calories)
→ Workout rationale: "Building muscle to increase your metabolic rate for weight loss"

User goal: "Move without pain (lower back)"
→ System prioritizes: Core stability, hip mobility, anti-rotation exercises
→ Workout rationale: "Strengthening muscles that support your lower back"

User goal: "Reduce stress"
→ System prioritizes: Gentle cardio, stretching, breathwork
→ Workout rationale: "Endorphin-boosting movement for stress relief"

### 7. Ethical Reward System (No Manipulation)

**The Problem with Traditional Apps:**
- Streaks create anxiety ("Don't break your streak!")
- Social comparison triggers inadequacy ("Your friends are ahead of you")
- Variable ratio reinforcement (slot machine tactics)
- FOMO mechanics ("Complete now or lose your bonus!")

**Alongside's Ethical Approach:**

**Credits System:**
- Earn credits for completing exercises (30-120 per exercise)
- Immediate feedback: Confetti animation + credit popup
- NO punishment for missing days (credits never expire or decrease)
- NO duplicate prevention gaming (can't spam same exercise)

**What Credits Are For:**
- Visual progress indicator (gamification without exploitation)
- Future: Unlock bonus content (meal plans, advanced workouts)
- Future: "Sweat Equity" system (earn credits, curb impulse spending)

**No Streaks:**
- NO "X days in a row" pressure
- Instead: "Total active days" (celebrate any movement)
- Missing a day is a fresh start, not a failure

**No Social Comparison:**
- NO leaderboards
- NO "friends are ahead of you" messaging
- NO public workout feeds
- Your journey is private, personal, yours alone

**Why This Matters:**
- **Neurodivergent-friendly:** ADHD users have dopamine dysregulation - variable rewards are harmful
- **Sustainable:** Intrinsic motivation (I feel good) beats external pressure (don't break streak)
- **Compassionate:** Celebrates effort, never punishes humanness

### 8. Workout Execution UI

**Problem:** Traditional apps show exercises as a list. Boring. Disconnected.

**Alongside's Approach:** Interactive workout cards with built-in timers, counters, and video links.

**Workout Flow:**

1. **Choose Your Option** (3 cards: Strength / Wellbeing / Cardio)
   - Tap card to see full workout details
   - Transparent rationale shown upfront
   - Estimated duration, energy requirement, equipment needed

2. **Start Workout** (Begins with warmup)
   - Exercise card shows: Name, reps/time, visual demo
   - "Play" button → Timer starts for time-based exercises
   - "Video" button → Opens YouTube search for form tutorial
   - Checkbox to mark exercise complete

3. **Track Progress** (Live feedback)
   - Exercise completed → Checkmark + mini celebration
   - Running total of credits earned shown
   - "Need a break?" button → Pause anytime, no penalty

4. **Finish & Celebrate** (Cooldown → Completion)
   - Final exercise done → Big confetti animation
   - "Great work! You earned [X] credits today"
   - Option to log notes: "How did it feel?"
   - Workout saved to history

**Key Features:**
- **Pause anytime:** Life happens, no guilt for interruptions
- **Skip exercises:** Not feeling an exercise? Skip it, system adapts
- **Modify on the fly:** "Make this easier" button shows modifications
- **Video tutorials:** Every exercise links to form videos (YouTube search)

### 9. Progress Tracking & Weekly Reports

**The Problem:** Most apps track everything (steps, calories, heart rate) but provide no actionable insights.

**Alongside's Approach:** Meaningful progress tracking with compassionate insights.

**What We Track:**

**Body Metrics:**
- Weight (weekly weigh-ins)
- Waist, chest, biceps, thighs (monthly measurements)
- Photos (optional, private, local-only)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Total workouts completed
- Total workout minutes
- Breakdown by type (strength, cardio, mobility)
- Credits earned

**Wellbeing Metrics:**
- Average energy (7-day rolling)
- Average mood (7-day rolling)
- Sleep trends
- Condition pain/difficulty trends

**Goal Progress:**
- Current weight vs. goal weight
- Milestones achieved
- Projected goal completion date

**Weekly Report (Opt-In):**

Every Sunday, users can view a compassionate weekly report:

> **"Your Week: December 25-31"**
> 
> 🏋️ **3 workouts completed** (Great consistency!)  
> ⚡ **Average energy: 6.2/10** (Steady and manageable)  
> 😊 **Average mood: 7.1/10** (Positive trend!)  
> 💪 **Most improved:** Lower back (pain down from 6 → 4)  
> 🎯 **Goal progress:** Lost 0.5kg this week (3kg from goal)  
> 
> **Insight:** Your energy dipped mid-week, but you adapted well by choosing gentler workouts. This is exactly how sustainable progress works - listening to your body.
> 
> **Next week:** Consider adding one more strength session if energy stays stable.

**Key Features:**
- **Opt-in only:** Users can disable reports if they find them stressful
- **Compassionate language:** Celebrates effort, never criticizes
- **Actionable insights:** Specific, realistic suggestions
- **Pattern recognition:** Highlights trends (energy improving, pain decreasing)

## 🌍 SOCIAL IMPACT & MARKET NEED

### The Fitness Industry's Exclusion Problem

**Traditional fitness culture is built on shame, comparison, and "no excuses" mentality.**

This actively harms:
- **Neurodivergent individuals** (15-20% of population)
- **Women managing hormonal changes** (51% of population)
- **People with chronic conditions** (20 million in UK)
- **Mental health struggles** (1 in 4 adults annually)
- **Busy parents** (7.3 million in UK)

**The result:** 63% of UK adults are overweight/obese, but 80% have tried and failed at fitness.

**The real problem isn't lack of motivation - it's that the tools are broken.**

### Why Neurodivergent-First Design Helps Everyone

**Universal Design Principle:** Designing for the most excluded improves experiences for all.

**Example: Curb Cuts**
- Designed for wheelchair users
- Benefits: Parents with prams, delivery workers, cyclists, elderly

**Example: Alongside**
- Designed for neurodivergent adults
- Benefits: Anyone with busy life, injuries, stress, or bad days

**Features that help ADHD users also help:**
- Busy parents (minimal executive function needed)
- Depressed individuals (no shame for bad days)
- Injured people (transparent safety considerations)
- Menopausal women (energy fluctuation adaptation)

### Market Opportunity

**UK Fitness App Market:** £500M annually (growing 15% YoY)

**Underserved Segments:**
- **Neurodivergent adults:** 10 million people, £50M opportunity
- **Women 35-55:** 8 million people, £40M opportunity
- **Chronic condition management:** 20 million people, £100M opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** £190M in UK alone

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** £50M (neurodivergent + female 35-55 + chronic conditions)

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** £5M (1% of SAM in Year 3)

**Alongside's Target:** 10,000 paid users by Year 3 = £600K annual revenue (0.12% of SAM)
